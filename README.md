## üìñ Background
- The case study that I Have worked on is [How can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?](Case_Study.pdf)
- The project executive summary, analysis, findings, and recommendations can be found in the [Project Report](Project_Report.pdf)
- The goal of this project is to analyze smart device fitness data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. We will focus on one of Bellabeat‚Äôs products called Leaf because the data tracked by this wearable is similar to the smart device data that   we will be using to perform our analysis. After analyzing the data, we will present our analysis on consumer trends to the Bellabeat executive team along with high-level recommendations for Bellabeat‚Äôs marketing strategy.

## üîç Findings and Recommendations
### Findings
1. Fitbit users tend to use the smart device on weekdays especially Tuesday to Thursday. The distribution of average time spent by all users for sedentary activity, light activity, fairly active activity, and very active activity is 81%, 16%, 1%, and 2% of total time, respectively. 
2. Among the 33 Fitbit users, 21 of them use the smart device daily for an average of 20 hours. 11 out of 21 daily users used more than 20 hours a day on average.
3. Fitbit users who use the smart device frequently tend to be very active. 11 Fitbit users spent more than 2% of the time on very active activity with an average of 53 minutes per day. Majority of such users used the smart device for more than 25 days.
4. More than 70% of Fitbit users track their sleeping habits to detect sleep abnormality. Among the 24 Fitbit users who track their sleeping habits, 12 users have more than one sleeping record per day within a month. One particular user id *‚Äò4445114986‚Äô* had 11 occurrences of more than 1 sleeping record within 28 days. 
5. More than 90% of the total 940 daily records have tracker distance. This shows that users are generally satisfied with the tracking accuracy of the smart device. In fact, the smart device has good tracking accuracy of 98%.
6. Daily users tend to keep track of their body weights compared to non-daily users. Among the 7 daily users, 3 of them have lost 1 to 2 kg in a month by doing very active activity for at least 22 days with at least 14 minutes per day on average. 

### Recommendations
1. Our findings have shown that frequent users tend to put on the smart device for around 20 hours a day. Therefore, I recommend the *Leaf* to be lightweight, water resistant, and have a long battery life span.
2. We can make the *Leaf* to have the necessary features for sports since 50% of the daily users wear it for high intensity activities.
3. Our *Leaf* must have a distance tracking accuracy of close to 100% so that we can attract consumers, who are very active in running long distances, to purchase our products.
4. Our *Leaf* must have the capability to track users‚Äô sleeping patterns and provide insights on their sleeping habits (i.e. frequency of waking up in the middle of sleep).
5. We can promote *Leaf* to consumers who are very active in sports and care about their daily wellness because they are more likely to be motivated to use the product and achieve their health goals.
